# **Test Monitoring & QA**

Test monitoring is a continuous activity throughout the TLC that compares test progress against the plan. It measures whether and how many *[exit criteria](/1/1/6.Test_Approach.md#exit-criteriadefinition-of-done)* have been met. It is through test monitoring that you discover if the team has fallen behind on the *[test schedule](/1/1/7.Test_Schedule.md)* or if you have hit a *[milestone](/1/1/7.Test_Schedule.md#milestones)*, with all that entails. Some kinds of monitoring can be *[automated](/0/1.Core_Concepts.md#automation)*, so this is something to consider.
Monitoring is an important part of both *[QC](/0/1.Core_Concepts.md#quality-control-qc)* *and* *[QA](/0/1.Core_Concepts.md#quality-assurance-qa)* on the testing procedure itself: QC because it assumes that practices can devolve and continuously watches the process to ward against that while faciliting corrective measures; QA because it seeks to ensure that best practices are maintained.
Monitoring can become excessive on smaller, less formal projects.
