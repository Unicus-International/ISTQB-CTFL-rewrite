# **Test Analysis**

Test analysis answers the question of 'what to test'. It can be thought of as the tester's exposure to the *[test basis](/1/1/2.Test_Scope.md#test-basis)* from the test plan-in-progress. With their *[technical expertise in testing](/1/4/1.Test_Types.md)*, testers define and prioritize ***test conditions***, that is, different things that need to be tested.

Test analysis is closely related to *[Test Design](/2/1.Test_Design.md)* and is the start of the logical throughline of the tester's activities in a TLC.

Test analysis should result in prioritized test conditions and a reports about defects in the test basis.
