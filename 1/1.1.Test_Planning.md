# **Test Planning**

## *Why?*
When starting a TLC, you will want to make a test plan. A test plan documents the context, the means, and the strategy of the testing activity. Creating a test plan organizes the testers' thinking around the test, and also creates something that can be shared around to get the people that matter on the same page, allowing for the TLC to fit into the bigger picture of delivering the product.

## *Contents*
A typical test plan covers:
* The scope of the test.
* The assumptions of the test.
* Who the test concerns and how.
* Who will be doing what.
* It covers how and how frequently the test team will expect and provide communication.
* A risk register.
* A Test Approach.
* A schedule.

The different contents of the Test Plan should be developed alongside each other and fit together, rather than being developed one after another. For example, the Risk register is important to consider for the Test Scope, but what risks are relevant also depends on the scope.

## *Test Scope*


* The test's objectives.
* The constraints around the testing.
* The test basis.
