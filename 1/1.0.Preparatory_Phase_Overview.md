# **Preparatory phase**

During the preparatory phase, there are many things to consider, depending on how formal the TLC is. These include:
- **[Test planning](/1/1.1.Test_Planning.md)**
- **[Test Roles and Role Distribution]()**
- **[Test analysis]()**
- **[Test Monitoring/QA]()**

All four points are worth considering to some degree for a test of any scale, but they are, for example, not always worth documenting for a given test.
The preparatory phase kind of glides over into the execution phase, especially when the tests are written as code. I've decided to minimize the preparatory phase in this rewrite, but it could easily be thought of as including both ***[test design]()*** and ***[test implementation]()***.
