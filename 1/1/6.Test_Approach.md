# **Test Approach**

A test approach is, simply put, how you go about testing in your TLC. It covers the main contents of your test plan, from the relevant test levels, the different types of tests you will be performing, what work products you will make along the way, the preconditions you need for your test, what it would take for the test to be considered done, what metrics you will collect. If you deviate from policy or typical strategies the approach should also cover those deviations.

## *Entry criteria/Definition of Done*

Entry criteria are things that should be in place before you start doing something. Entry criteria do not *have* to be met, but if they are not met they will make it harder, possibly to the point where it is not worth starting. For example, you will want to ensure that you have an available and appropriate testing environment before you start. Entry criteria are known as a Definition of Ready (to start) in some contexts. Both entry criteria and ***[exit criteria](/1/1/6.Test_Approach.md#exit-criteriadefinition-of-done)*** can be thought of as checklists.

## *Exit criteria/Definition of Done*

Exit criteria are an outline of at what point the activity is done. Therefore it is also known a *Definition of Done*. Typically a test's exit criteria include both measures of thoroughness (such as having achieved the desired level of coverage) and completion criteria (such as having reported all found defects). You should have clear exit criteria at each *[test level](/0/4.Test_LifeCycle.md#nested-tlcs-test-levels)*. It is worth remembering that "running out of time" is a valid exit criterion, provided the people who run the risk in case of a failure are aware of the situation and give the go-ahead anyway.

## *Common elements in test approaches*

***[Shift-Left](/0/1.Core_Concepts.md#shift-left)*** was covered under core concepts. It speeds up the LifeCycle, so it is popular.

***[DevOps](/0/1.Core_Concepts.md#devops)*** was also covered under core concepts and often goes hand-in-hand with Shift-Left.
