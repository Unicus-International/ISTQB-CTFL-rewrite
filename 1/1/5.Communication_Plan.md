# **Communication Plan**

Communication should be thought of as a two-way street. The testing team needs to inform the many concerned parties appropriately, and needs to keep an open ear for any changes, for example, to the specifications they are testing for or to any eventual deadline that are decided upon by concerned parties with authority over the testing team. Having a communication plan will make everyone's lives easier in that regard. It should provide an outline of how and how often you will be updating the various concerned parties and expect to be updated by them, as well as alternative channels for communication of unscheduled (and therefore possibly *very important*) information. As you can see, being good at communicating with the other concerned parties is a vital skill for testing, as it is for most teamwork.

***Remember that you can only collaborate as fast as you can communicate!***

Beyond teamwork, it is through communication that you avoid trouble with the various [concerned parties](/1/1/4.Concerned_Parties.md). For example, the vision of a commissioner might change, and involving concerned parties like commissioners frequently makes it more likely that you avoid adding to your workload.

## *Platforms & Formality*

If the development team has not already selected a communication platform, the testing team should decide on one to use among themselves, and perhaps propose it for the greater team. Having a communication platform greatly speeds up the pace of *informal* communication, which thereby speeds up everything else that depends on it (though it may also prove to be a distraction that slows you down).
It should also be noted that some concerned parties will want more formal kinds of communication. Here are some communication channels to consider, roughly organized by how formal they are:
- Verbal communication
- Chat rooms
- Dashboards
- Email
- Documentation
- Test reports

## *Feedback*

There are two main kinds of feedback loops in typical projects. Retrospectives and Reviews. For the purposes of a Communication *plan*, it is important to *plan* for these at a level of formality that is appropriate for your TLC.

### *Retrospectives*

Retrospectives are important for self/team-improvement, and are usually held at the end of some kind of (life) cycle. Retrospectives look at the cycle and ask how things can be made even better.

### *Reviews*

Reviews are basically smaller TLCs with a specified kind of test ([static](/2/0.Test-execution_Phase_Overview.md)) and several testers running tests informally and in parallell while logging everything they find or think about it. Afterwards they pool their assessments in a meeting so they can determine what anomalies were defects, as well as what should be done about each and who should do it. Finally, each defect gets reported so they can be followed up. Some reviews also follow-up on the reported defects to confirm that they've been dealt with.

#### *Review types*

- Informal review:
  Mainly focused on finding defects, and less structured
- Walkthrough:
  Author-lead walkthroughs can be part of a bigger review or serve as reviews on their own when the purpose is to guide reviewers through the test object. It can serve other purposes, too!
- Technical review:
  The reviewers are technically qualified and led by a moderator. Basically the kind outlined under *[reviews](/1/1/5.Communiation_Plan.md#reviews)*.
- Inspection:
  Even more formal; Not just basically the kind outlined under *[reviews](/1/1/5.Communiation_Plan.md#reviews)*, but aiming to find as many anomalies as possible, and also collecting metrics. Does not allow the author to lead or record the process on behalf of the team.

#### *Review roles*

- Manager
  Decides what will be reviewed and ensures that people can participate.
- Author
  Works on the text object under review.
- Moderator/Facilitator
  Moderates the meetings by keeping track of time and giving people room to speak freely.
- Scribe/Recorder
  Gathers the anomalies from reviewers and records information from the meetings.
- Reviewer
  Performs reviews. Analogous to a tester for other TLCs.
- Review leader
  Takes responsibility by deciding who to involve and deciding on a time and place for the review.
