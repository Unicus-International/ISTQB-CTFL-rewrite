# **Roles in the TLC**

There are two main roles in the TLC. The ***test management*** role and the ***tester*** role. These roles are not mutually exclusive and a person's role can change within a TLC, and can really be adopted by anyone depending on the context (results may vary!). It is generally a good idea to separate concerns, so while the same person can fill both roles, especially for larger-scale projects, it is prudent to ensure these roles are distinguished.

## *Test Management*

Test management takes responsibility for the overall process, team and leadership. A test manager should be focused on *[test planning](/1/1.Test_Planning.md)*, [*monitoring*, *control*](/1/4.Test_Monitoring.md) and *[completion](/3/)*, ensuring that those things are handled properly so the ***testers*** can do more effective work at testing.

## *Tester*

The tester takes responsibility for the technical aspect of testing, and is mostly concerned with *[test analysis](/1/3.Test_Analysis.md)*, *[design](/2/)*, *[implementation](/2/)* and *[execution](/2/)*.

Testers should be able on all the fronts covered under *[essential skills](/0/3.Essential_Skills.md)*, including technical knowledge which is useful in analysis, design and implementation.

Otherwise, continue to *[test analysis](/1/3.Test_Analysis.md)*
