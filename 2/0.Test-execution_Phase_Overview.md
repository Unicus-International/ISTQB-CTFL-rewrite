# **Test execution phase**

During the test execution phase the main things to consider should be easily confirmed with the *[test plan](/1/1.Test_Planning.md)*, leaving the testers to focus on designing, implementing and executing the test(s).

- **[Test design](/2/1.Test_Design.md)**
- **[Test implementation](/2/2.Test_Implementation.md)**
- **[Test execution](/2/3.Test_execution.md)**

Again, there is no clear cutoff-point between preparation and execution phase, especially when using a broad definition of the execution phase.
