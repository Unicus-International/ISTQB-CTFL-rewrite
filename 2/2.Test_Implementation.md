# **Test Implementation**

With both the question of 'what to test' and 'how to test' answered by test analysis and design respectively, test implementation prepares everything (***testware***) so that the tests can be executed. What that entails depends entirely on the design of the test environment from *[test design](/2/1.Test_Design.md)* and the other decisions made there.

It takes the developed test cases and organizes test procedures,often putting them in test suites. It then sets up a test schedule.

The expected output of test implementation is everything needed for test execution. Beyond the aforementioned, that ranges from automated test scripts to test data to the elements that make up the designed test environment.
