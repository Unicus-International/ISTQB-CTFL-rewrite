# **Test Execution**

With all the preparations done, test execution is fairly simple; You just follow the test execution schedule from *[test implementation](/2/2.Test_Implementation.md)*. However, while doing that there are some other things to keep in mind. You need to ensure that the test environment is correctly *[configured](/0/1.Core_Concepts.md#configuration-management)*, remember to also perform *[regression testing](/0/4.Test_LifeCycle.md#level-independent-tests)*, ensure that the *[test metrics](/1/3.Test_Monitoring.md#test-metrics)* required for *[monitoring](/1/3.Test_Monitoring.md)* are being collected, and cross-confirm that you are matching the Test Plan's *[schedule](/1/1/7.Test_Schedule.md)*. Finally, when a defect is found it is important that it is logged so it can be reported. 

As always, the scale and severity of these activites depends on the formality of the surrounding TLC. The expected output from test execution is test logs (and *[defect reports](/3/1.Defect_Management.md#defect-reports)*).
