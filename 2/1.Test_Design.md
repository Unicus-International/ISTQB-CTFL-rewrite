# **Test Design**Â¨

Test design is the second step in the logical throughline of the tester's activities in a TLC. It takes the answer from *[test analysis](/1/4.Test_Analysis.md)* (the question was "what to test?"), the ***test conditions***, and elaborates on 'how to test' them. It draws more extensively on the *[technical knowledge](/1/4/1.Test_Types.md)* of testers than test analysis does, and uses it to identify the appropriate coverage items and *[techniques](/1/4/2.Test_Techniques.md)*.

In light of that, it may be worth looking over those two links again; It was relevant there, but is *more* relevant here.
