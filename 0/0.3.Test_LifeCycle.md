# **The Test LifeCycle (TLC)**

The Test LifeCycle (henceforth: TLC) consists of three phases:
1. [Preparatory phase](/1/1.0.Preparatory_Phase_Overview.md)
2. [Test-execution phase](/2/2.0.Test-execution_Phase_Overview.md)
3. [Reporting phase](/3/3.0.Reporting_Phase_Overview.md)

The rest of this text is organized around the TLC. If you follow the links above they will take you to the overview of the different phases.

## *Nested TLCs*

There is a TLC for every test, and just about all tests can be broken up into smaller tests which would then have their own TLCs. At the highest level of analysis you can have a TLC for the entire (software) development lifecycle.
A higher-level TLC may need information from the Reporting phase of the smaller tests inside of it to proceed to the next tests in an informed manner, or before it can proceed to its own Reporting phase. Therefore it may be easier to think of them in order

### Test levels

Here is an illustration of nested TLCs in the syntax of the Python programming language. To understand it you need to know three things:
1. any line ending with a '(' is an activity you want to start.
2. Anything on a line that comes after '#' means nothing to the code.
3. As in math, everything inside of parentheses '( what is here)' has to be calculated before the activity can continue. Thus, the parentheses are the key to understanding the figure.

``` python
acceptance_testing(
    # Before starting acceptance test execution you need to know that
    # System integration testing is in order
    # Therefore, it might have any number of the next line as "arguments"
    # The number depends on the scale of the product
    system_integration_testing(
        # Similarly, system integration test execution needs to know that
        # System testing is in order
        # Therefore, it might have any number of the next line as "arguments"
        system_testing(
            # And so it goes
            # System testing needs to know Component integration tests
            component_integration_testing(
                # Finally, component integration tests depend on components
                component_testing(
                green_light_from_component_developers
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```
