When going over the ISTQB CTFL syllabus, I did not like how it was organized. I figured that it could improve my learning outcomes as well as possibly assist others with a secondary source that is organized a little differently.
This rewrite aims to preserve the information in a more accessible format.
It is organized around the process you would follow when working on tests, what I will call the "test lifecycle" (TLC):
- Section one tackles different test roles and considerations at the start of the TLC, like risks, time-estimates, tools and planning.
- Section two tackles the main body of the TLC, including different kinds of tests, test implementation and execution.
- Section three covers the end of the TLC, such as reporting and reviewing what was learned during the test and what test-byproducts should be kept around.

It should be understood that the TLC is a somewhat fractal structure. In every TLC there is room for many smaller TLCs, and if you look at a given TLC, chances are that it is part of a bigger TLC. The level of detail depends on the scale and seriousness of the project, and can be expected to change over the course of most TLCs.

It should also be noted that this rewrite will not include any sources beyond the link to the original in this file. I assume that readers have access to the original and can check sources from there. The only new concept in this rewrite is it being organized around the TLC.

The original syllabus involves a knowledge-rating system for the various points on the curriculum. That will not be carried over to this rewrite.
The same goes for needlessly complicated words that are not part of the test-relevant vocabulary. For example, to make it easier to read, this rewrite will not mention stakeholders, but instead talk about the people whom it might concern in some way or another. I aim to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

Thank you for reading. I hope you will find this work useful!
