# **Reporting Phase**

The reporting phase is the end of the TLC and easily the shortest phase. You can think of the *[test progress reports](/1/3.Test_Monitoring.md#test-progress-reports)* covered earlier as the end of smaller, nested TLCs within the bigger TLC. Beyond that, there are two main kinds of reports to cover: Those associated with ***Defect Management*** and those associated with ***Test Completion***.
