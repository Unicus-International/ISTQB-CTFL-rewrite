# *Test Completion*

Test Completion usually occurs at a *[milestone](/1/1/7.Test_Schedule.md#milestones)*. In closing a TLC, test completion covers any eventual lose ends, and produces a ***Test Completion Report*** for *[concerned parties](/1/1/4.Concerned_Parties.md)* (as with *[test progress reports](/1/3.Test_Monitoring.md#test-progress-reports)*, note that different concerned parties will be interested in different things!). During test completion you analyze the testware you've produced to find which might be useful in the future. You either archive that testware or hand it over to an appropriate team. You may also want to have a *[retrospective](/1/1/5.Communication_Plan.md#retrospectives)* to go over what you should change, have learned, and can improve.

Expected output from Test Completion is the ***Test Completion Report***, and a ***backlog***.

## *Test Completion Report*

Test completion reports draw on your preceding *[test progress reports](/1/3.Test_Monitoring.md#test-progress-reports)* and other data, such as the documentation from your *[retrospective(s)](/1/1/5.Communication_Plan.md#retrospectives)*. Typically, you will want to include:

* Test summary
* Testing and product quality evaluation based on original test plan
* Deviations from the test plan (schedule, duration, effort...)
* Impediments and workarounds
* Metrics from progress reports
* Unmitigated risks and unresolved defects
* Test-relevant lessons from the retrospective

## *Backlog*

A backlog from test completion should highlight issues and actions that need to be taken to improve the product development (and development process) in the aftermath of the TLC.
